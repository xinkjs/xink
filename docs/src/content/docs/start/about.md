## Attributions
xink stands on the shoulders of giants. A special shoutout and thanks goes to [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit), as I used some of their code for various things; as it was not feasible to fork their code directly, and there's no reason to re-invent the wheel. Therefore, I've added a copyright for them in the license and marked relevant code with a short attribution.

Thanks to [Deigo Rodríguez Baquero](https://github.com/DiegoRBaquero) for donating the `xk` npm package, which is our cli tool.

## Origins
Pronounced "zinc", the name is based on the Georgian word [khinkali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinkali); which is a type of dumpling in the country of Georgia. The transcription is /ˈxink'ali/. To be clear: khinkali's beginning proununciation is dissimilar from "zinc".
