title: Quickstart
---

Getting started with xink is a one-liner. It creates a project in the directory name of your choice; `myapi` in our example.
```bash
npx xk create myapi
```

The above command seeds a hello world route at `/` with a `GET` handler, so go ahead a fire up the dev server.

```
cd myapi

bun run dev
[p]npm run dev
deno task dev
```
