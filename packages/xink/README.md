# @xinkjs/xink

xink is a directory-based filesystem router for APIs - and a Vite plugin. Under the hood, it uses a trie URL router, which is fast and scalable. It supports the bun, cloudflare, and deno runtimes.

We're currently in the beta phase of development and welcome contributions. Please see our contributing guide.
